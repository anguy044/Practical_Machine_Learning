Weight Lifting Form Prediction using Accelerometer Data
Course Project for Coursera class "Practical Machine Learning"

The goal of his project is to predict the weight lifting form from the accelerometer data collected from 6 participants [1-2].
We use the random forest model which provides very good prediction of the form of the weight lifting exercises.
